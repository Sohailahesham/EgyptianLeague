# EgyptianLeague
The Egyptian League wanted to stop using paper any more and wanted to create a dashboard to handle all players signed to different teams. Using an ORM connected to a relational database of your choice, implement a REST API for the Egyptian League Dashboard. You should have a route for teams and another one for players. The client using the dashboard should be able to:

- Get all teams
- Get one team's details
- Get players by team
- Get one player's details
- Search for a player's name
- Add new players, delete retired ones
- Transfer a player from a team to another
- Change a player's salary
- Change team shirt color

Make sure you design your database precisely to acheive the desired features. Implementing Authentication is optional but recommended.
